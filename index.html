							<p><strong>System Administration:</strong> I've also enjoyed configuring systems, whether it's building out ESXi servers to handle multiple services for end users, managing Call Manager, or replacing fiber or Ethernet connections between NICs.</p>

							<h2>Professional Self-Assessment
							</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p>Throughout my journey in the computer science program, my coursework and recent ePortfolio development have allowed me to showcase my strengths and shape my professional goals in software development and security. Initially, I had planned to transition from the Army to the civilian workforce, but exciting opportunities within the military have inspired me to stay and apply both the certifications I’ve earned and the skills I’ve gained from my computer science program, as well as my experience as a network administrator in the military. </p><p>A recent project that highlights my professional development is my capstone, based on a mobile app I created in my mobile architecture class. I enhanced the app by integrating encryption and optimizing the SQLite database to store and retrieve decrypted messages, emphasizing my focus on both security and user functionality. Since then, I’ve made further improvements, including adding user-friendly features and implementing salting to strengthen the encryption process.

										<h3>My capstone</h3>
										<p>As you might have guessed, I've based my capstone around my time in service. The Army uses AES-256 bit encryption, and for my project, I've created an app that sends messages using the same encryption standard with a user-generated key.</p>
										<p>Additionally, unencrypted messages are saved in an SQLite database for quick retrieval later, and everything is protected by a user-created account.</p>

									<p><strong>Screen red light filter option:</strong> If you've spent any time in the field, you already know why light is prohibited.</p>
									
									<p>Once logged in, there's an option to enable a red lens filter. This feature is less noticeable to anyone nearby and helps preserve your natural night vision in low-light conditions. This feature conintues to work even when you minimize the application.</p>
